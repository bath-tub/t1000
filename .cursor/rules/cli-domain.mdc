# CLI Domain Rules

- Commands live in `src/j2pr/cli.py` and must preserve existing CLI surface area.
- Use Typer options/args with explicit exit codes: `0` success, `2` needs-human, `3` failed.
- Outputs should be concise; prefer Rich tables for lists, JSON for `--json`.
- Keep `scan`, `run`, `run-next`, `status`, `open`, `tail`, `config validate` behavior stable.
