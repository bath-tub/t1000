# Agents Guide Requirement

- Always read `agents.md` before starting work.
- If you get stuck or discover important context, update `agents.md` with:
  - what failed,
  - where to find artifacts/logs,
  - the resolution or workaround.
- If you are working in a specific domain, also update the matching domain rule with any new guidance.
- Keep entries concise and actionable for future agents.
